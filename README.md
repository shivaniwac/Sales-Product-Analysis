Data analysis and visualization are critical skills for data scientists and analysts. In this report, I will take you through the steps I followed to analyze a dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle, one of the most prestigious sites for datasets, and performed various data analysis and visualization tasks using popular Python libraries.
Through this analysis, I explored and visualized the dataset using Pythonâ€™s powerful libraries in Jupyter Notebook. Starting with basic data exploration, 
I proceeded to create insightful visualizations that tell a comprehensive story about the data. 
While Seaborn was my preferred library for most visualizations due to its simplicity and aesthetic appeal, Plotly was useful for specific chart types like pie charts. 
This workflow showcases the versatility and power of Python for data analysis and visualization.
